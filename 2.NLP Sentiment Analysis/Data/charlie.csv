Wed Oct 23 13:16:52 +0000 2019,1186994901277261824,    Mining is how Bitcoin and Litecoin is distributed fairly. Miners being greedy is in the whitepaper. Bitcoin works if miners are greedy. Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt care if miners are in it for profit or in it for ideology.,SatoshiLite
Wed Oct 23 13:16:13 +0000 2019,1186994739460988930,    No need to attack me personally. I never thought printing money out of thin air is a good idea. Unless you think I printed Litecoin out of thin air. You must not understand how mining works.,SatoshiLite
Wed Oct 23 13:09:24 +0000 2019,1186993024099745792,    I disagree pretty strongly with this. Bitcoin was too powerful of an idea to not have succeeded even if everyone was in it for profit from the start. The whole point of Bitcoin working is that people act selfishly and for profit and Bitcoin still works.,SatoshiLite
Wed Oct 23 13:04:06 +0000 2019,1186991688448786432,    But we are still in the middle of distribution. Half the coins are distributed after the first halving (4 years). I don‚Äôt see why the initial 1 year of coins (1/8 of all coins) matters more for incentives to make Bitcoin not a scam and other coins a scam.,SatoshiLite

Wed Oct 23 10:27:19 +0000 2019,1186952231808954368,"     There will be fees and spread with atomic swaps, so you won't get 1:1 conversion.",SatoshiLite

Wed Oct 23 10:22:12 +0000 2019,1186950944073740288,"     This is a good thought experiment.

Pegouts take a while to be spendable. So if you want to cash out your MW coins immediately, you may be willing to get less for it.

Wed Oct 23 09:42:40 +0000 2019,1186940998145851392,"    By definition, a softfork forces all miners to follow the rules or they are orphaned.

Wed Oct 23 09:31:57 +0000 2019,1186938299086036992,     EB comes with a compromise. Of course! So did SegWit. The question is if the compromise is worth the benefit we are getting. No one is saying EB is flawless.,SatoshiLite

Just like with SegWit, old nodes will see those ""anyone-can-spend‚Äù spent to a normal address. That‚Äôs the peg-out.",SatoshiLite
Wed Oct 23 09:20:27 +0000 2019,1186935407239290881,    That doesn‚Äôt make much sense. How does EB give miners power to force a fork?,SatoshiLite
Wed Oct 23 09:07:11 +0000 2019,1186932065532403712,"     3 things:
- atomic swaps require agreeing to a market price
- there‚Äôs going to be a spread, so you lose value
- there may not be liquidity
